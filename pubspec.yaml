description: This project implements Dart definitions and API helpers for the [Bungie.net API](https://github.com/Bungie-net/api). It's based on [bungie-api-ts](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/bungie-api-ts) that is meant for use in [Destiny Item Manager](http://destinyitemmanager.com), but should be general enough to use in any project. The code is completely generated from Bungie's documentation - I considered using something like Swagger Codegen, but instead opted for a custom generator so we could make the result as nice as possible.

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# Read more about versioning at semver.org.
version: 2.3.5+5
